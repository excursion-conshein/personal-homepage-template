My name is Excursion ConsHein (Chinese name: 远行). Currently, I am a research assistant in Excursion Lab in Tsinghua University (THU). Before that, I received Bachelor Degree of Engineering in Mechanical Engineering, Tsinghua University (THU) in China. 

I am interested in multi-robot, especially air-ground collaboration. Also, my research interest is including aerial manipulation. What I hope now is that a well-eqipped lab can assist me to work for my interest better. 

In my spare time, I am a big fan of badminton. During my undergraduate stage, I joined the badminton association in THU.
